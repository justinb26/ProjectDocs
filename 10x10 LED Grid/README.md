# 10x10 LED Grid

## What's In It:
	- 1x Arduino Duemilanove (ATMEGA328P)
	- 100x LPD8806 Serial Addressable RGB LEDs
	- 1x Translucent Enclosure
	- Full-size USB A->B Cable


## What It Does:
	Provides an addressable 10x10 matrix of RGB Lights. Can be used as a platform for general purpose app development, for learning arduino development, and for creating a low-resolution screen mirroring display.	


## What You Need 
	- A computer (Windows, OSX, or Linux)
	- Arduino software (http://arduino.cc)
	- (Optional) Processing software (http://processing.org)


## Links to Code

	(Arduino Sketch "Skeleton" - Provides "SetPixel(x,y,color)" function, runs example pattern)

	(Arduino Sketch - Adalight (modified) - Turns the Arduino into a client for the Processing sketch)

	(Processing Sketch - Mirrors your screen to the LED grid. Grid must be running modified Adalight sketch, above, and be connected to the computer running the Processing sketch)
